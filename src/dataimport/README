#RE-Config and MySql Data Import notes and requirements
#Requires python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 and libraries MySQLdb 
First - set up the RE admin dependencies and set permissions by executing rfex_admin.sql with root on the mysql server:

mysql -u root -ppassword < rfex_admin.sql

It is also recommended taking a look at MySQL's /etc/my.cnf If you have millions of associations, then you should consider following the my-large.cnf (See MySQL documentation) settings

#Config
if you want to call your database a different schema name then tcga, you will want to replace the rfex_admin.sql 'tcga' with name you want and then modify one of the example config/rfex_sql.config files.  
The host can be localhost, or the actual server name. If you are running the data import on the db server, then localhost is best, if you are running the data import from a different server, then put in the entire address, such as machine.systemsbiology.net with the appropriate port. The server you are on must have access to the db server.  

The rfex_admin.sql contains grant statements and it is important that you replace the existing server name of saskatoon with your server name. 
Within the config file, the path dictated needs to exist, since the script only creates dir dynamically relative to this path.  
[results]
path=/titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs_sandbox/parsed_associations

If you were to update the random_forest database name for the chrom and ref info, be aware that RE contains a google-dsapi-svc.config file containing this database name and you will need to update this and then redeploy the same name war file in your web app server. 

#MySQL Engine
RE db tables are using the MyISAM engine, versus InnoDB, since MyISAM is better fitted for read-intensive (select) and offers full-text indexing and simpler to design and drop.

#SH
From python dir, run sh:
There should be corresponding sh files to the config files setup above, the commands required for the sh is:
dataset_label feature_matrix_file associations_file dataset_comment dataset_description re_instance

#RFACE analysis example:
sh load_rface_associations.sh test_gbm_rface /titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs/gbm/gbm.merge.u133a.31oct.hg18.tsv /titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs/gbm/rf.u133a.31oct.mask1.F/all_associations.out "BRCA Her2 subset" "59 Her2-classified patients" internal

#All Pairs example:
sh load_pairwise_associations.sh test_kirc_0206_pw /titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs/kirc/bigMerge.06feb12.hg18.tsv /titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs/kirc/bigMerge.06feb12.pwpv "Kidney" "Kidney sandbox" public

Regarding processing time, we are averaging about 800,000-1 million edges per minute. It is recommended that you modify your /etc/my.cnf to have high memory settings as quite a number of views, indexes and buffers are used.
