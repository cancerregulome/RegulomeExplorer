First - set up the RE admin dependencies and set permissions by executing rfex_admin.sql with root on the mysql server:

mysql -u root -ppassword < rfex_admin.sql

if you want to call your database a different name then tcga, you will want to replace the rfex_admin.sql 'tcga' with name you want and then modify one of the example config/rfex_sql.config files.  
The host can be localhost, or the actual server name, the rfex_admin.sql does a grant, in the file provided, 
the server name is saskatoon, therefore if you decided to use a server name, replace saskatoon and rerun the rfex_admin.sql 

If you were to update the random_forest database name for the chrom and ref info, be aware that RE contains a google-dsapi-svc.config file containing this database name and you will need to update this and then redeploy the same name war file in your web app server. 

From python dir, run sh:
There should be corresponding sh files to the config files setup above, the commands required for the sh is:
dataset_label feature_matrix_file associations_file dataset_comment dataset_description
ie:
sh load_sandbox_rface_associations.sh test_gbm_rface /titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs/gbm/gbm.merge.u133a.31oct.hg18.tsv /titan/cancerregulome3/TCGA/outputs/gbm/rf.u133a.31oct.mask1.F/all_associations.out "BRCA Her2 subset" "59 Her2-classified patients"
